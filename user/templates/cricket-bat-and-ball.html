        In cricket, each playing side has 11 players and one of them is appointed as captain. Apart from these 11 players, there are a few more players on each side who can only field as substitute for an injured team member. The fielding team should have 11 players and the opposition can send only two batsmen on the ground at the time of play. A 15-member squad is a must for all international tournaments conducted by the cricketâ€™s governing body, International Cricket Council (ICC).
